Let's compare the two Java programs you provided:

### SumOfSines1:
```java
public class SumOfSines1 {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        double t = Double.parseDouble(args[0]);
        double radians = Math.toRadians(t);

        System.out.println(t);
        System.out.println(radians);
        System.out.println((2 * Math.sin(5 * radians / 2)) * (Math.cos(-radians / 2)));
    }
}
```

### SumOfSines:
```java
public class SumOfSines {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        double t = Double.parseDouble(args[0]);
        double radians = Math.toRadians(t);

        System.out.println(t);
        System.out.println(radians);
        System.out.println((Math.sin(2 * radians)) + (Math.sin(3 * radians)));
    }
}
```

#### Similarities:

1. **Input Handling:** Both programs take a command-line argument (presumably an angle in degrees) and convert it to radians using `Math.toRadians`.

2. **Print Statements:** Both programs print the original angle (`t`), its equivalent in radians, and the result of the trigonometric calculation.

3. **Trigonometric Calculations:** Both programs involve trigonometric calculations using the `Math.sin` and `Math.cos` functions.

#### Differences:

1. **Trigonometric Expression:**
   - **SumOfSines1:** Calculates \(2 \sin\left(\frac{{5t}}{2}\right) \cos\left(\frac{{-t}}{2}\right)\).
   - **SumOfSines:** Calculates \(\sin(2t) + \sin(3t)\).

2. **Coefficients and Operations:**
   - **SumOfSines1:** Involves coefficients 2 and 5, and multiplication and addition operations.
   - **SumOfSines:** Involves coefficients 2 and 3, and addition operation.

3. **Difference in Coefficient and Operation Order:**
   - **SumOfSines1:** Multiplies the sine term by 2 and the angle term by 5 before performing the trigonometric operations.
   - **SumOfSines:** Multiplies each sine term by its respective coefficient.

In summary, while both programs involve trigonometric calculations based on user input, they differ in the specific expressions they compute. SumOfSines1 seems to follow a specific formula involving coefficients and operations, whereas SumOfSines directly calculates the sum of two sine terms. The choice between the two would depend on the specific mathematical relationship you intend to represent in your application.
