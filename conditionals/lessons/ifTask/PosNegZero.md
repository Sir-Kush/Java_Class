Check for Validation from ChatGPT about task 4


Let's review your code against the requirements of the task:

1. **No Input Provided**:
   - Your code checks if the length of the `args` array is 0 to determine if no input was provided.
   - If no input is provided, it prints an error message prompting the user to provide a number as a command-line argument.
   - After printing the error message, it gracefully exits the program using the `return` statement.

2. **Invalid Input**:
   - You attempt to parse the input argument as an integer using `Integer.parseInt()`.
   - If the parsing fails due to invalid input (e.g., non-integer input), a `NumberFormatException` is thrown.
   - Your code catches this exception and prints an error message indicating that the input is invalid.
   - After printing the error message, it gracefully exits the program using the `return` statement.

3. **Checking Number Sign**:
   - After successfully parsing the input as an integer, your code proceeds to check the sign of the number.
   - If the number is greater than 0, it prints that the number is positive.
   - If the number is less than 0, it prints that the number is negative.
   - If the number is equal to 0, it prints that the number is zero.

Your code effectively handles all the conditions specified in the task. It accurately determines whether the input number is positive, negative, or zero, and it gracefully handles cases where no input or invalid input is provided. Therefore, your code meets the requirements of the task. Well done!
