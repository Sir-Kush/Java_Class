AgeGroup.java  README.md


Check for assessment and error handling in my program:

Thank you for providing the question. Let's assess your solution based on the provided criteria:

```java
public class AgeGroup {
    
    public static void main (String [] args) {
    
    // Condition 1: No input provided
        if (args.length == 0) {
            System.out.println("Error: Provide valid integer to the command-line input");
            return; // Exit the program gracefully
        }

    // Condition 2: Invalid input.
        int age;
        try {
            age = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
        } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
            System.out.println("Error: Invalid input. Please provide a valid integer for age");
            return; // Exit the program gracefully
        }

        // Determine the age group
        if (age < 0) { 
            System.out.println("Invalid age: Age cannot be negative");
        } else if (age <= 12) {
            System.out.println("Your age is: " + age + ". You are a child");
        } else if (age <= 19) {
            System.out.println("Your age is: " + age + ". You're a teenager");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Your age is: " + age + ". You're an adult");
        }

    }
    
}
```

Here are some observations and potential improvements:

1. **Input Validation**:
   - You correctly check if any input is provided and handle cases where no input is provided.
   - You also handle cases where the input is not a valid integer using a try-catch block for `NumberFormatException`, which is good.

2. **Invalid Age Handling**:
   - You correctly handle the case where the age is negative by printing "Invalid age: Age cannot be negative".

3. **Output Clarity**:
   - The output messages are clear and informative, providing the age and corresponding age group.

4. **Boundary Cases**:
   - The program correctly categorizes ages within the specified ranges for child, teenager, and adult.

Overall, your solution addresses the requirements of the task and handles input validation and age categorization effectively. However, here are a few suggestions for improvement:

- Consider adding more descriptive error messages for invalid input or negative ages to provide clearer guidance to the user.
- You may want to include additional checks to handle edge cases, such as ages equal to 0 or ages above 120 (or any other reasonable upper limit), depending on your requirements.

Your solution is well-written and effectively accomplishes the task. Keep up the good work!



Solution to the real problem with more option for functionality: 

Certainly! Here's an improved version of the `AgeGroup` program based on the provided corrections and suggestions:

```java
public class AgeGroup {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Check if an age is provided as input
        if (args.length == 0) {
            System.out.println("Error: Please provide an age as input.");
            return;
        }

        // Parse the input argument as an integer age
        int age;
        try {
            age = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
        } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
            System.out.println("Error: Invalid input. Please provide a valid integer for age.");
            return;
        }

        // Check if the age is negative
        if (age < 0) {
            System.out.println("Error: Invalid age. Age cannot be negative.");
            return;
        }

        // Determine the age group
        String ageGroup;
        if (age <= 12) {
            ageGroup = "child";
        } else if (age <= 19) {
            ageGroup = "teenager";
        } else {
            ageGroup = "adult";
        }

        // Print the age group
        System.out.println("Your age is: " + age + ". You're a " + ageGroup + ".");
    }
}
```

In this improved version:
- We added more descriptive error messages to provide clearer guidance to the user.
- We explicitly handle the case where the age is negative, printing an error message instead of attempting to categorize it.
- The logic for determining the age group remains the same, categorizing ages into child, teenager, and adult groups based on the provided ranges.
- We use a `String` variable `ageGroup` to store the determined age group, improving readability and code organization.
- Finally, we print the age group along with the provided age, providing informative output to the user.

This version addresses the suggestions for improvement while maintaining the functionality of categorizing ages into appropriate age groups.
