Certainly! Here are some tasks involving `if` statement conditions:

1. **Check Even or Odd:**
   Write a program that takes an integer input from the user and prints whether it is even or odd.

2. **Grade Classification:**
   Write a program that takes a numerical grade input from the user and prints the corresponding letter grade (A, B, C, D, or F) based on the following criteria:
   - A: 90-100
   - B: 80-89
   - C: 70-79
   - D: 60-69
   - F: Below 60

3. **Leap Year:**
   Write a program that takes a year as input and prints whether it is a leap year or not. A leap year is divisible by 4, but not by 100 unless it is also divisible by 400.

4. **Positive, Negative, or Zero:**
   Write a program that takes a number as input and prints whether it is positive, negative, or zero.

5. **Triangle Classification:**
   Write a program that takes three integers as input representing the lengths of the sides of a triangle and prints whether the triangle is equilateral, isosceles, or scalene.

6. **Vowel or Consonant:**
   Write a program that takes a character as input and prints whether it is a vowel or a consonant.

7. **Maximum of Three Numbers:**
   Write a program that takes three numbers as input and prints the largest among them.

8. **Age Group Classification:**
   Write a program that takes an age as input and prints the corresponding age group:
   - Child: 0-12 years
   - Teenager: 13-19 years
   - Adult: 20 years and above

9. **Number Comparison:**
   Write a program that takes two numbers as input and prints whether the first number is greater than, less than, or equal to the second number.

10. **Quadratic Equation Roots:**
    Write a program that takes three coefficients (a, b, c) of a quadratic equation (ax^2 + bx + c = 0) as input and prints the nature of its roots (real and distinct, real and equal, or imaginary).

These tasks should provide you with a good opportunity to practice using `if` statements with various conditions. Let me know if you need further assistance with any of these tasks!
