LargestNum.java README.md assessment from ChatGpt

Check for any correction:

Your code appears to correctly implement the requirements of the task. Let's review it:

1. **No Input Provided**:
   - Your code checks if the length of the `args` array is less than or equal to 2 to determine if fewer than three integers were provided as input.
   - If fewer than three integers are provided, it prints an error message prompting the user to provide three integers as input arguments.
   - After printing the error message, it gracefully exits the program using the `return` statement.

2. **Invalid Input**:
   - Your code attempts to parse the input arguments as integers using `Integer.parseInt()`.
   - If the parsing fails due to invalid input (e.g., non-integer input), a `NumberFormatException` is thrown.
   - Your code catches this exception and prints an error message indicating that the input is invalid.
   - After printing the error message, it gracefully exits the program using the `return` statement.

3. **Finding the Largest Number**:
   - After successfully parsing the input as integers, your code proceeds to find the largest number among them.
   - It uses a series of comparisons to determine the largest number (`a`, `b`, and `c`).
   - It correctly prints the largest number among the three input integers.

Your code effectively handles all the conditions specified in the task. It correctly finds and prints the largest number among the input integers and gracefully handles cases where no input or invalid input is provided.

Based on the evaluation, your code meets the requirements of the task. Well done! You can consider it as a successful completion of the task.
